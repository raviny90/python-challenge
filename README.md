Create a Python script to analyze and modernize the vote-counting process for a small, rural town using a set of poll data called [election_data.csv]. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate.

The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote


Considerations
Import modules like csv; to read and write files in various formats
Store contents in variables, lists, and dictionaries
Iterate through basic data structures
Debug along the way
